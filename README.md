## Project Description:

<img align="center" src="./Main screen.png">

**The AIR** landing page project involves the implementation of a responsive landing page based on [Figma design](<https://www.figma.com/file/7qwsWggv9BAxMi2VPhBuPr/Air-(formerly-Dia)?node-id=9138%3A35>). The implementation was carried out using the _BEM_ (Block Element Modifier) methodology and _SCSS_ for styling. The page was _adapted_ to different screen sizes, which ensured an optimal user experience on all devices.

## Technologies:

1. HTML5

- The entire site is written in HTML5. Using _BEM_ (Block Element Modifier) methodology.

2. JS

The following functions were implemented using JS:

- Slider;
- Disabled form submission;
- Activation of the Pop-up menu (burger-menu);
- When the burger menu is activated, the scroll disappears;
- Closing the menu by clicking on link.

3. SCSS

- The styling of the entire page is handled using the SCSS preprocessor, allowing for more modular and maintainable CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.

### Screen Adaptations:

- Large screens 2560px
- The design 1600px
- Desktop 1280px
- Small desktop 1024px
- Tablet 640px
- Mobile (> 320px)
